## Support

[GoDaddy has acquired ThemeBeans](https://richtabor.com/?p=907), and in the spirit of open source — the entire ThemeBeans WordPress theme catalog is now freely available here on GitHub. However, **theme support and remote updates are only available for current license holders**, and up to April 9th, 2020.
